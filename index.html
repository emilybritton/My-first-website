<h1>Why Jojo's Bizarre Adventure is the Best Anime</h1>
<p>Below you will find reasons on why JJBA is the best anime and should be watched.
</p>
<h2>The Plot</h2>
<p>Every season feels like a new show but they are all connected together through a family tree. First season was about vampires, second season was about Gods, third season had big, strong men that had super powers from tarot cards, season four is about a murder mystery, season five is about Italian mafia, and six is based in prison.</p>
<p>There are more manga's with different plots for each book, but those have not been made into shows yet. The newest one has been adapted as a Netflix original that will be coming out at the end of this year. The girl, Jolyne, is the daughter of the main character from season three.</p>
<p> Each season has the protagonist as a family of the Joestar line, and their first name is always Jo, hence why the show is called Jojo's Bizarre Adventure.</p>
